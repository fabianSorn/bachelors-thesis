\Abstract
Good performance plays an essential role in the usability of software products.
This is not only true for consumer software but also for professional software
like monitoring GUI applications used at CERN, the European Organization for
Nuclear Research. They allow experts to easily monitor a large number of devices
and adapt their settings when necessary.

An essential component of such monitoring applications are graphs, which allow
the presentation of a large data set in an easily understandable and compact
form factor. Strong deviations and general trends can be discovered more easily
which allows reacting to them. The work was conducted in the Applications
section in the Beams Controls group. With the change to PyQt for new native GUI
applications, the question raises, which python library is suitable for this
task. Next to the features of each library, their speed in the later application
plays a central role. A bad performance will significantly lower the
productivity of the application's user since he is slowed down by having to wait
for the system to respond to his interaction.

The goal of this work is to develop a framework, which allows testing the
performance of python graph libraries in specific use cases. The user has to be
possible to depict his use cases using the framework without much effort and
without having to be familiar with performance testing. Using the framework
should be easy for users familiar with other python testing frameworks. Through
the on-demand creation of profiles for the given use case, advanced users should
have the opportunity to find performance bottlenecks and eliminate them.

To reach this goal we begin with a general overview of the fundamental topics of
data visualization and benchmarking as well as the application framework Qt.
Following that, real use cases are presented which originate from monitoring
applications, which are being developed at CERN at the time of writing. Based on
these requirements and prior findings a concept for the central tasks of the
framework as well as all involved components is developed.  The concept is
implemented using python 3 as the programming language of choice. The evaluation
of the implementation is done in two separate steps.  First, all collected use
cases are implemented using the framework to make sure that the functionality
meets our requirements. This is followed by the presentation of the recorded
results for each use case. To evaluate the accuracy of the recorded results, a
separate use case is compared to a minimal implementation of the fitting
application.
